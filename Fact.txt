I hate watermelons....heh.

Reply from Charles: Although I'm not crazy about real watermelon,
I love the artificial watermelon flavor, like what they use in candy/gum.

Hmm...I guess artificial watermelon is okay...but is there actual watermelon flavoring in it?  

White chocolate contains no actual chocolate.
